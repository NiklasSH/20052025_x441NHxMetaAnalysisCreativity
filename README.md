+++ Attention +++

Author 1 had their Overleaf editor session open prior to an Overleaf outage on the day of the conference deadline and continued working during the outage without realizing there was an issue. 
As a result, important changes to the library and the discussion of Research Question 2b made during that session were unintentionally overwritten. 
This was not noticed until after the extended submission deadline of 12:00 PM EST.

All lost changes have been restored and are reflected in the updated version:

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
